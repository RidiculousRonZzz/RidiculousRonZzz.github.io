Hi! I am a junior undergraduate of the Tsien Engineering Excellence Program (TEEP) at Tsinghua University.
Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Chun Yu](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/) and Dr. Weinan Shi at [Pervasive Interaction Lab, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I am particularly interested in the following topics:
* Human AI Collaboration
* Creativity Support Tools
* Trust and Explainable AI
* Intelligent Speech Interaction
* Generative Models, e.g. Diffusion Models
