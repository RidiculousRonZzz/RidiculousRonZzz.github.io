Education
======
* Undergraduate in Qian Xuesen Class of Mechanics, Xingjian College, Tsinghua University, September 2021 - July 2025
  * GPA: 3.82/4.00
  * Major ranking 9/28, top 30% in the department (eligible for recommendation for postgraduate studies)

Project experience
======
* Establishing a Trustworthy RAG Intelligent Data Management System
October 2023 - Present: Research Project
  * A RAG data management system combined with LLMs capable of providing natural language query capabilities based on user files.
  * Mainly responsible for table data parsing, knowledge extraction, literature research, and determining research topics. Model the psychology of users and automatically adjust the content displayed to the user based on their level of trust. The user’s trust level is calculated based on their understanding of the system, behavior during use (clicking, data review, etc.), and proactive rating after Q&A.

* Face Recognition System in Unconstrained Environments
October 2023 - December 2023: Course Project
  * Designed an unconstrained face recognition system based on ResNet and Triplet Loss/Angular Loss algorithms, capable of determining if two photos are of the same person. The image recognition accuracy reached 92%.
  * Received an A in the “Introduction to Deep Learning” course.


* GIX International Summer Research Program
July 2023 - September 2023: Summer Research Project
  * Researched integrating context awareness in human-AI co-creation of images. Submitted a first-author long paper to CHI and was accepted by CHI24.
  * ContextCam: Bridging Context Awareness with Creative Human-AI Image Co-Creation

* Application of API Chain in AI Painting Interactive Agents
March 2023 - September 2023: SRT Project
  * Designed an AI painting application based on API Chain for use in AI painting interactive agents, converting users’ natural interactive expressions into control over the API Chain, enabling users to easily generate and modify images according to their needs. Lowered the technical barriers to AI painting and optimized user experience.

* “Ijiaodui” Intelligent Customer Service Prompt Design
January 2023 - March 2023
  * Designed ChatGPT prompts and integrated its functions into the “Ijiaodui” WeChat public account customer service.

* Visualization Analysis and Algorithm Optimization of Dual Mic Noise Reduction
March 2022 - March 2023: SRT Project
  * Implemented dual microphone noise reduction, speech recognition, and visualization in python, and subsequently developed an Android app for mobile phones.

* Context-Aware Smart Desktop Interaction
March 2022 - June 2022: Course Project (Received an A in the “Theory and Practice of Human-Computer Interaction” course.)
  * Implemented context awareness based on technologies like facial recognition. For example, privacy protection during group discussions, program handoff, mobile control of computers and computer replying to mobile messages, sit-to-unlock, etc.

* Chess Game Based on Qt
April 2022 - May 2022: Course Project (Received an A- in the “Fundamentals of Computer Programming” course.)
  * Developed a chess game using Qt, including basic movement rules and advanced game mechanics (e.g., pawn promotion, castling, check, etc.). The game features a timer and a user-friendly interface. Supports AI vs. player and player vs. player modes.
